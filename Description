This document describes the creation of a 250 bar hydrogen filling station.
It is intented for small-scale hydrogen production and is thus designed to allow filling up (at least) 1 CNG tank with hydrogen at 250 bar of pressure. 
Any size of tank can be attached, but the standard size for use will be the 3 gallon, type 1, CNG tank.

A 3 gallon CNG tank, filled with hydrogen at 250 bar, would be able to contain 11,35 kWh or hence 96 % of the energy in a 1 liter gasoline tank.
Calculation: 11,35 l x 0,003 kWh/l x 250 bar = 8,51 kWh / 8,83 kWh = 0,96 x 100 = 96% 

The station is also designed to use an electrolyzer that generates Brown's gas (HHO) but which is foreseen to separate off the oxygen -which forms at the anode (+-side) -. 
The reason why an HHO electrolyzer is used is because this type of electrolyzer is cheaper than regular electrolyzers designed to make hydrogen. 
Since hydrogen is thus made (and not Brown's gas), there is less risk of explosion when the gas is compressed by the compressor.

USE

A relatively small and cheap refill station like this could be useful for small enterprises (and perhaps individuals) to refill swappable hydrogen tanks. 
These tanks can then be used in either:
* single-fuel vehicles that are used for driving small distances with it after which they can be refilled again. This is useful for say vehicles operating in cities (i.e. delivery vehicles)
* flexible-fuel vehicles. For instance cars that have a tank with liquid fuel for covering large distances with it, and a hydrogen tank for city use.

WORK OUT

Since we'll need it able to fill up a 3 gallon tank, the electrolyser of the filling station would need to be able to generate 11,35 liter of hydrogen, and then compress this to 250 bar. 
The time of filling is best limited to 10 minutes or less, so the electrolyser needs to produce at least 0,189 liter per minute.
Inlet gas amounts to the compressor need to match with the outlet flow of the electrolyser.
